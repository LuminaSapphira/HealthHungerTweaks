# Health and Hunger Tweaks
### For Minecraft 1.11.2 (Forge 2425 / AppleCore 2.2.2)
Modifies the way Minecraft manages food and the corresponding health regeneration in the following ways:
 * Decreases hunger drain (1/2 normal rate)
 * Gives an effect (Satiated) to players when eating food that disables hunger drain for its duration
 * Disables health regeneration from saturation and fullness (*come on, it had to be balanced*)
 * Provides a Health Kit system to compensate

*Author's Note: This is my first Minecraft mod. I made attempts to follow conventions, but no promises.*
